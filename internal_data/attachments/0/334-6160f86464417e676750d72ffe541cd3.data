Hello,

I purchased a flight on June 15, 2015 for $391.70 via usairways.com. Today I found the exact same flights for $50 less, at $341.70 on your website. You can imagine my dismay. It seems I'm being punished for buying the flight early. I called US Airways customer service to see if anything could be done to mitigate the fare difference. The first agent I spoke to (after being transferred from new reservations) showed no empathy to my situation whatsoever. I understand he had to follow certain guidelines. However I expected him to be more solution-oriented and less curt. 

I then requested to speak with a supervisor. The supervisor recommended I write to you, Customer Relations, to humbly request a waiver of the reissue/change fee so that I can benefit from the newer, lower airfare. I would like to take advantage of the lower fare of $341.70 without paying the $200 change fee. 

I bought this flight from your airline because you have stepped up for me in difficult situations in the past. Please assist me and waive the reissue fee so I can continue that loyalty to your company.

Sincerely,

[My Name]
