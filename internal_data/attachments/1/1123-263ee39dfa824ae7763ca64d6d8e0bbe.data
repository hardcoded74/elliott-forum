Should you decide to pursue a claim for the amounts not paid by your primary insurance, please forward the Explanation of Benefits and we will process a claim payment at that time.  Unfortunately, without a physician advising of your medical need to return early due to your injury, your policy would not provide benefits for your Trip Interruption expenses claimed.  It is for this reason that we must maintain our position of denial for your Trip Interruption claim.    Your policy states the following:ÒSECTION IV. COVERAGESTRIP INTERRUPTIONWe will pay a benefit, up to the maximum shown on the Schedule of Benefits, if You are prevented from continuing or resuming Your Covered Trip due to any of the Unforeseen events listed below.For Trip Cancellation or Trip Interruption, Unforeseen Events Include:(a) Accidental Injury, Sickness or death of You, Your Traveling Companion, Your Family Member, or Your Business Partner; which results in medically imposed restrictions as certified by a Physician at the time of loss preventing Your participation or continued participation in the Covered Trip. A Physician must advise cancellation of the Covered Trip on or before the Scheduled Departure Date.Ó Please understand that our action at this time should not be construed as a waiver of any and all rights and defenses which the Company may have under the policy in question and any applicable statutory or common law, all of which are hereby expressly reserved.We are sorry we cannot respond more favorably at this time.  However we must adjudicate claims per the terms, conditions, limitations and exclusions of the policy.  If you have additional information which you believe might have a bearing on our decision, please forward it to us at the attention of our Appeals Unit.Respectfully,Jill StainbrookJill Stainbrook, PCLSClaims AnalystSeven Corners, Inc.
