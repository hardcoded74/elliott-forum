June 23, 2016Helen OÕLeary1005 Terrace ST #704Seattle,  WA  98104Certificate Number: 	1JHBWA14-100112  Claim Type:                      Trip InterruptionDear Helen OÕLeary:As the claims administrator for American Modern Home Insurance Company, we received your claim relating to your trip interruption.  We have reviewed the facts related to your loss and have determined that we are unable to make payment for the following reasons listed below. Your policy lists specific reasons when benefits apply.    In order for your claim to be considered an interruption due to accident/illness, a physician must impose restrictions that prevent your continued participation in the covered trip.  The documentation submitted confirms that while you sought medical treatment,  there were never any restrictions imposed for you not to continue on with your trip and you traveled another 15 days after treatment before making the decision to end your trip and return home.   Since the policy requirements were not met, we are unable to pay your claim.The policy language that is pertinent to this matter is listed below:BENEFITSTRIP CANCELLATIONWe will pay a benefit, up to the maximum shown on the Schedule of Benefits, if You are prevented from continuing or resuming Your Covered Trip due to any of the Unforeseen events listed below.(a) Accidental Injury, Sickness or death of You, Your Traveling Companion, Your Family Member, or Your Business Partner; which results in medically imposed restrictions as certified by a Physician at the time of loss preventing Your participation or continued participation in the Covered Trip. A Physician must advise cancellation of the Covered Trip on or before the Scheduled Departure Date.Please understand that our action at this time should not be construed as a waiver of any and all rights and defenses which the Company may have under the policy in question and any applicable statutory or common law, all of which are hereby expressly reserved.We apologize that we cannot respond more favorably at this time. If you have any questions regarding your claim, please contact us.  If you have additional information which you believe might have a bearing on our decision, please forward it to us at the attention of our Appeals Unit.Respectfully,Deborah C.Claims Analyst
