Dear Uber:My rider rating has been stuck at 4.79 for many many months; it never changes, no matter how many rides I take. Since it’s statistically impossible that each driver is rating me so precisely that my overall rating remains at 4.79, I suspect this is a technical glitch on Uber’s end. Please investigate this and let me know the resolution. Much appreciated! And happy holidays.Rachel R.---------Hi Rachel, I'm Dillu from Uber's Priority Support Team.The situation you have reported is certainly not the experience we expect a rider like you to have with Uber.I understand you are concerned about your rider rating. Let me clarify this to you.Your rating is an average of the ratings you’ve received from drivers from all the trips you’ve taken so far. Please keep in mind that very few people have a perfect rating, so don’t worry if your average isn’t 5.0.Knowing a little bit more about what matters to drivers could help you get a 5 star rating. Below are a few of the areas that drivers frequently consider when rating a rider:1. Short wait times - Drivers love when riders are ready to go when they arrive at the pickup location. That includes making sure the location you entered is actually where you’ll be. Keep an eye on your app once you’ve matched with a driver so you know when to head outside.2. Courtesy - Simply put, it’s important that riders treat drivers and their cars the way they’d expect to be treated themselves. A positive attitude and considerate use of the car, like not eating in the vehicle, can go a long way.3. Safety - Drivers want to make sure everyone in their car is safe, and shouldn’t feel pressured to break any laws. For example, every rider in the car should have their own seatbelt, so if you have an extra friend you want to squeeze in, consider requesting an uberXL instead.I hope this information is helpful. Before we go, I want to thank you for your continued support as a gold member. Have a nice day.Dillu S---------I am not concerned that my rating isn’t 5-stars; rather, I am concerned that my rating hasn’t changed at all in many many months, despite having taken multiple rides and ordered regularly from Uber Eats. As you noted, the rating is an average. Therefore, the number should CHANGE from time to time, not stay the same ride after ride. If you do not understand this concern or are unable to give a sufficiently detailed answer, please escalate this issue to a manager. Thank you.Rachel R.---------Hi Rachel, sorry to hear about the inconvenience this may have caused. I'm Meera from Uber's Priority Support Team.I understand that you wish to know that why your rating is not getting change. I'll do my best to address this concern and update you with the details. Things that may seem small to you could actually matter quite a bit to your driver. For example, it’s easy to accidentally slam a door if you’re not thinking about it, so knowing a little bit more about what matters to drivers could help you get a 5 star rating. Drivers frequently consider these 3 areas when rating a rider:1. Short wait times - Drivers love when riders are ready to go when they arrive at the pickup location. That includes making sure the location you entered is actually where you’ll be. Keep an eye on your app once you’ve matched with a driver so you know when to head outside.2. Courtesy - Simply put, it’s important that riders treat drivers and their cars the way they’d expect to be treated themselves. A positive attitude and considerate use of the car, like not eating in the vehicle, can go a long way.3. Safety - Drivers want to make sure everyone in their car is safe, and shouldn’t feel pressured to break any laws. For example, every rider in the car should have their own seatbelt, so if you have an extra friend you want to squeeze in, consider requesting an UberXL instead. Riders and drivers can anonymously rate each other from 1-5 stars after each trip. This system helps ensure that both the rider and driver are accountable for their behavior, and creates a respectful, safe environment for everyone.Your rating is an average of the ratings you’ve received from drivers on all your trips taken so far. Please note that you won’t receive a rating for any canceled trips, regardless of if the trip was canceled by you or the driver.If your rating isn’t currently available on the main menu of your app, simply click on the 3-bar menu icon on the top left corner and use the following steps:1. Select Help2. Select Account and Payment Options3. Select Changing my account settings4. Select I’d like to know my rating5. Select SubmitWhen you press Submit you should be able to view your rating instantly. Moreover, we have been unable to charge an outstanding balance of $4.59 to your payment method for a trip on December 23rd, 2019 5:32pm MST . You will be unable to request a ride until this balance is paid in full. Please add a new form of payment in your app. Alternatively, with your permission, we can charge your balance to a different payment method attached to your account. Please let us know your preference.Meera M---------Please escalate this to a manager who speaks fluent English. This is a question of math, not behavior. If a driver rated me 4 stars (or less), my rating would go down. Conversely, if a driver rated me 5 stars, it would go up. But my rating hasn’t changed at all this year from 4.79. That is mathematically impossible. Therefore, a technical issue must be affecting my rating, preventing it from updating. Since drivers cannot rate a rider with 4.79 stars, and even if they could it would be extremely unlikely every single driver would, then the only remaining conclusion is that your system is not updating my rating and is stuck on 4.79. Please correct this technical issue with your software, and update me when it has been resolved. Thank you.Rachel R.---------Hi Rachel, Thanks for reaching out about ratings.

Please escalate this to a manager who speaks fluent English. This is a question of math, not behavior. If a driver rated me 4 stars (or less), my rating would go down. Conversely, if a driver rated me 5 stars, it would go up. But my rating has not changed from 4.79 in more than eight months despite many rides and UberEats orders. That is mathematically impossible. Therefore, a technical issue must be affecting my rating, preventing it from updating. Please correct this technical issue with your software, and update me when it has been resolved. As for your payment concern, this is another bug in your software. Not only wasn’t your system able to charge the tip separately for a trip that used Uber Cash, it apparently also didn’t notify you that it was paid this morning prior to my trip to Denver Airport. The $4.59 tip charge has already cleared on my credit card.Rachel R.---------Hi Rachel,I apologize that there has been a delay in someone reaching out to you. I'm Piyush from Uber's Priority Support Team..I completely understand your concern regarding the Rating. Let me help you with this.I would like to inform you that your rating is an average of all your trips taken so far, and one low rating won’t have a significant impact on your overall rating.Please note that in an effort to keep the rating system fair to both riders and drivers, we’re unable to provide, adjust, or remove ratings for individual trips.However, as you take more trips over time, you may see your rating even out.Keep in mind that canceled trips don’t factor into your overall rating, regardless of if the trip was canceled by you or the driver.If you have any more questions or concerns, please let us know, we're always happy to help.PiyushG---------Please forward this to a manager in technical support. This is a BUG in your software, NOT a concern that I don’t have a 5-star rating! The problem is that MY RATING NEVER CHANGES no matter how many rides I take. It is mathematically IMPOSSIBLE that my rating would remain at 4.79 month after month after month. Each rating from each ride should cause the rating to change, but it never changes from 4.79. It has been 4.79 all year. It never changes. THIS IS A BUG that your programmers need to address. If you who are reading this are not a manager, forward this to a manager in technical support.Rachel R.---------Hi Rachel,My name is Pearl.

I AM REPORTING A BUG. I’ve likely received twenty-three “5-star” ratings and six “4-star” ratings, which would equal my overall 4.79. That was my rating at the beginning of 2019 and HAS NEVER CHANGED SINCE. This is mathematically impossible, as just ONE additional rating changes the calculation! If my last driver gave me a “3-star” rating, my average would change to 4.73; if she gave me a “4-star” rating, it would change to 4.77; and if she gave me a “5-star” rating, it would change to 4.8. BUT THE OVERALL RATING NEVER CHANGES FROM 4.79 NO MATTER HOW MANY RIDES I TAKE. Ergo, this is a BUG. If you are not a technical support manager, then please forward this to an actual I.T. programmer at Uber who can resolve this issue.Rachel R.---------Hi Rachel,We're sorry for the trouble and we appreciate your patience with us.Riders and drivers can anonymously rate each other from 1-5 stars after each trip.

We appreciate your patience while we worked to resolve this issue.I've checked your account and it seems like your overall rating is $4.79. Stacey I'd like to inform you that riders and drivers can anonymously rate each other from 1-5 stars after each trip. This system helps ensure that both the rider and driver are accountable for their behavior, and creates a respectful, safe environment for everyone.However, I definitely got your point here and would like to inform you that your current rating is correct. However, when a trip ends, the rating your driver provided for you will not be shown in your overall rating until after you’ve provided a driver rating, or taken your next trip. The same is true for drivers.This ensures ratings are as fair as possible for both parties. If your rating isn’t currently available on the main menu of your app, simply click on the 3-bar menu icon on the top left corner and use the following steps:1. Select Help2. Select Account and Payment Options3. Select Changing my account settings4. Select I’d like to know my rating5. Select SubmitWhen you press Submit you should be able to view your rating instantly.I hope this information is helpful, and appreciate you getting in touch. Thanks for being a gold member.Bharti---------My rating is not correct. It has been stuck at 4.79 since the beginning of the year. It never changes, no matter how many rides I take or how many Uber Eats I order. I don’t mind that it’s 4.79; what concerns me is that IT NEVER CHANGES, and that is mathematically impossible. Just this month I took five rides, rated each driver 5 stars, saw each of them rate ME five stars, and yet my rating didn’t change all all. This is a BUG that tech support needs to address. PLEASE forward this bug report to a manager so it can get fixed. I’m really losing patience with Uber’s unwillingness (or inability) to resolve this problem. It’s so obviously a BUG!Rachel R.
