I am very upset on the promise the staff at Garden Grove Nissan gave to me . I was speaking to Joel and Angela and Angela promised me that no matter my credit they will get me approved and not to worry. I was going there because of the promise that was made to me. Joel told me to test drive car and also don’t worry we will get you in one today. I have told them before hand I have a repo, no co-signer and have my credit score. They still said don’t worry we will get you approved. I am the only parent in home supporting my household, and needing a second car because my car now is for my fiancé to get kids to school pick them up, get to Dr appointments. Then I need a car for me to get to both my jobs everyday. The finance manager I believe i believe his name is Juan had Joel have me fill out info for my fiancé to see if he could co sign, but they did not even call him to make sure it was ok to run his credit & Joel had me sign his signature. I felt that was awkward. Then I show the manager of all the texts messages of promises coming from Angela And Joel and I feel that’s not right. I have all my texts if I need to send them to you. I am very upset that it was a waste of my time, and getting my hopes up . They should not of been allowed to run my fiancé credit without speaking to him. I request for something positive to come out if this or I will contact the Attorney General of Ca. I would appreciate a response via mail or email. No calls. I was at dealer on Friday 8/30/19 @ about 1pm.
